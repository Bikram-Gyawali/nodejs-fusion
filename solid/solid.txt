What are SOLID Design Principles?

SOLID is an acronym that stands for:

    Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
    Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)



The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The single responsibility principle states that a class, module, or function should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do one thing.

For example, a class that shows the name of an animal should not be the same class that displays the kind of sound it makes and how it feeds.
